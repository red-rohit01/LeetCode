    // The solution relies on the observation that we must cross each row and each column between given positions to get from 
    //the startPos to the homePos. So, we will always incur cost of each row and column between home and start positions atleast once.

    //It must also be observed that it's always best to travel through rows and column in the direction of start to end position 
    //and never beneficial to go in the opposite direction since we would then incur costs twice with no benefits. That is, we 
    //must traverse the shortest path from start to end.

    // In the below solution, we are travelling from end to start just to avoid extra condition (as we have been given cost of 
    //rows & columns of ending cell but not of the start cell).
